# Population-Health-PGHD
Population Health Using Patient-Generated Health Data (PGHD) – Research project exploring how patient-supplied data from wearables, mobile apps, and EHRs can improve healthcare outcomes, personalized care, and population health management. Includes reports, case studies, presentations, and analysis.
# 🌍 Population Health Utilizing Patient-Supplied Data (PGHD)

This repository contains a **research project** developed as part of the **Health Informatics program at Michigan Technological University**.  
The project investigates the role of **Patient-Generated Health Data (PGHD)** in **population health management** — exploring how data from **wearables, mobile apps, remote monitoring devices, and EHRs** can be integrated to improve healthcare delivery and outcomes.  

---

## 📌 Project Overview  
Patient-Generated Health Data (PGHD) includes **biometric data, lifestyle habits, symptoms, home-monitoring results, and patient-reported outcomes**.  
By integrating PGHD into healthcare systems, we can:  

✔️ Improve **personalized care** and treatment adherence  
✔️ Enable **early detection & prevention** of chronic diseases  
✔️ Empower patients to take an active role in their care  
✔️ Support **population-level insights** for health disparities and interventions  
✔️ Advance **clinical research and innovation**  

---

## 🚀 Key Goals  
1. **Safeguard patient integrity** and ensure secure, ethical use of PGHD  
2. **Maximize provider-patient relationships** through better engagement and shared decision-making  
3. **Encourage patient data donation** to advance research and public health innovation

## 📊 Implementation Process  
The project was developed through:  

1. **Systematic Research** – Review of literature, policies, and technical frameworks on PGHD  
2. **Team Collaboration** – Weekly project updates, task distribution, and peer reviews  
3. **Case Studies** – Real-world use cases of PGHD for chronic disease prevention, treatment personalization, and health system optimization  
4. **Analysis** – Identifying challenges such as **data interoperability, patient engagement, and privacy/security concerns**  
5. **Recommendations** – Strategies for successful PGHD adoption, including **AI/ML integration, patient education, and governance frameworks**
